# Cookiecutter - Python Project

A cookiecutter project template for Python Projects. By using [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), consistent Python projects can be
achieved with common constructs. Many great projects already use cookiecutter
behind the scenes (Ansible, Molecule).

## Requirements

- [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

## Usage

Execute the following and answer the relevant questions.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/cookiecutter-python-project
```

### Example

In this example we will create an Ansible role for NGINX.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/cookiecutter-python-project
...
```

Once the above is completed our new nginx directory will look similar to:

```bash

```

## Licensing

The current licensing model is MIT by default.
